# bip39toago
The <https://a-maugli.github.io/bip39toalgo/> is the Github web page 
for the repository <https://github.com/a-maugli/bip39toalgo>, forked from the original
repository <https://github.com/abmera/bip39toalgo>

In the <https://github.com/a-maugli/bip39toalgo> repository the `node app` and the `web app` 
was rebuilt from sources. This seemed the appropriate way, as `bip39toalgo` handles very sensitive data.
